# Tennis-Tournaments

Tennis-Tournaments is a project that allows us to keep track of the tournaments we have attended as spectators. You are able to create a new tournament which is going to be set by default to "haven't attended", and once you have attended the tournament you can click on it to change its status.

 # Status of the project
 
 The project is not finished yet, the user is able to create a new tournament and to change the status of the tournament but the user interface needs to be polished. As you can see in the gif, once the user clicks on a desired tournament the button is going to change to a list item, that happens because the boolean changes from false to true (attendance).
 
 In this gif we are going to add a new tournament to the list, and also change its attendance status:
